When I wrote the following pages, or rather the bulk of them, I lived alone, in the woods, a mile from any 

neighbor, in a house which I had built myself, on the shore of Walden Pond, in Concord, Massachusetts, and earned 

my living by the labor of my hands only.I lived there two years and two months. At present I am a sojourner in 

civilized life again.

I should not obtrude my affairs so much on the notice of my readers if very particular inquiries had not been 

made by my townsmen concerning my mode of life, which some would call impertinent, though they do not appear to 

me at all impertinent, but, considering the circumstances, very natural and pertinent.



当我写后面那些篇页，或者后面那一大堆文字的时候，我是在孤独地生活着，在森林中，在马萨诸塞州的康科德城，瓦尔登湖的

湖岸上，在我亲手建筑的木屋里，距离任何邻居一英里，只靠着我双手劳动，养活我自己。在那里，我住了两年又两个月。目前

，我又是文明生活中的过客了。

要不是市民们曾特别仔细地打听我的生活方式，我本不会这般唐突，拿私事来渎请读者注意的。有些人说我这个生活方式怪僻，

虽然我根本不觉得怪僻，考虑到我那些境遇，我只觉得非常自然，而且合情合理呢。
