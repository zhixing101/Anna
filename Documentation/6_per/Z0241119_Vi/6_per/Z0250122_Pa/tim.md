INAUGURAL ADDRESS

BY PRESIDENT DONALD J. TRUMP

U.S. Capitol

Washington, D.C.

12:10 P.M. EST

THE PRESIDENT: Thank you. Thank you very much, everybody. (Applause.) Wow. Thank you very, very much.

Vice President Vance, Speaker Johnson, Senator Thune, Chief Justice Roberts, justices of the Supreme Court of the United States, President Clinton, President Bush, President Obama, President Biden, Vice President Harris, and my fellow citizens, the golden age of America begins right now. (Applause.)

From this day forward, our country will flourish and be respected again all over the world. We will be the envy of every nation, and we will not allow ourselves to be taken advantage of any longer. During every single day of the Trump administration, I will, very simply, put America first. (Applause.)


Our sovereignty will be reclaimed. Our safety will be restored. The scales of justice will be rebalanced. The vicious, violent, and unfair weaponization of the Justice Department and our government will end. (Applause.)

And our top priority will be to create a nation that is proud, prosperous, and free. (Applause.)

America will soon be greater, stronger, and far more exceptional than ever before. (Applause.)


I return to the presidency confident and optimistic that we are at the start of a thrilling new era of national success. A tide of change is sweeping the country, sunlight is pouring over the entire world, and America has the chance to seize this opportunity like never before.


But first, we must be honest about the challenges we face. While they are plentiful, they will be annihilated by this great momentum that the world is now witnessing in the United States of America.


As we gather today, our government confronts a crisis of trust. For many years, a radical and corrupt establishment has extracted power and wealth from our citizens while the pillars of our society lay broken and seemingly in complete disrepair.


We now have a government that cannot manage even a simple crisis at home while, at the same time, stumbling into a continuing catalogue of catastrophic events abroad.


It fails to protect our magnificent, law-abiding American citizens but provides sanctuary and protection for dangerous criminals, many from prisons and mental institutions, that have illegally entered our country from all over the world.


We have a government that has given unlimited funding to the defense of foreign borders but refuses to defend American borders or, more importantly, its own people.


Our country can no longer deliver basic services in times of emergency, as recently shown by the wonderful people of North Carolina — who have been treated so badly — (applause) — and other states who are still suffering from a hurricane that took place many months ago or, more recently, Los Angeles, where we are watching fires still tragically burn from weeks ago without even a token of defense. They’re raging through the houses and communities, even affecting some of the wealthiest and most powerful individuals in our country — some of whom are sitting here right now. They don’t have a home any longer. That’s interesting. But we can’t let this happen. Everyone is unable to do anything about it. That’s going to change.


We have a public health system that does not deliver in times of disaster, yet more money is spent on it than any country anywhere in the world.

And we have an education system that teaches our children to be ashamed of themselves — in many cases, to hate our country despite the love that we try so desperately to provide to them. All of this will change starting today, and it will change very quickly. (Applause.)


My recent election is a mandate to completely and totally reverse a horrible betrayal and all of these many betrayals that have taken place and to give the people back their faith, their wealth, their democracy, and, indeed, their freedom. From this moment on, America’s decline is over. (Applause.)


Our liberties and our nation’s glorious destiny will no longer be denied. And we will immediately restore the integrity, competency, and loyalty of America’s government.


Over the past eight years, I have been tested and challenged more than any president in our 250-year history, and I’ve learned a lot along the way.


The journey to reclaim our republic has not been an easy one — that, I can tell you. Those who wish to stop our cause have tried to take my freedom and, indeed, to take my life.


Just a few months ago, in a beautiful Pennsylvania field, an assassin’s bullet ripped through my ear. But I felt then and believe even more so now that my life was saved for a reason. I was saved by God to make America great again. (Applause.)


Thank you. Thank you. (Applause.)

Thank you very much. (Applause.)


That is why each day under our administration of American patriots, we will be working to meet every crisis with dignity and power and strength. We will move with purpose and speed to bring back hope, prosperity, safety, and peace for citizens of every race, religion, color, and creed.


For American citizens, January 20th, 2025, is Liberation Day. (Applause.) It is my hope that our recent presidential election will be remembered as the greatest and most consequential election in the history of our country.


As our victory showed, the entire nation is rapidly unifying behind our agenda with dramatic increases in support from virtually every element of our society: young and old, men and women, African Americans, Hispanic Americans, Asian Americans, urban, suburban, rural. And very importantly, we had a powerful win in all seven swing states — (applause) — and the popular vote, we won by millions of people. (Applause.)

To the Black and Hispanic communities, I want to thank you for the tremendous outpouring of love and trust that you have shown me with your vote. We set records, and I will not forget it. I’ve heard your voices in the campaign, and I look forward to working with you in the years to come.


Today is Martin Luther King Day. And his honor — this will be a great honor. But in his honor, we will strive together to make his dream a reality. We will make his dream come true. (Applause.)


Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. (Applause.)


National unity is now returning to America, and confidence and pride is soaring like never before. In everything we do, my administration will be inspired by a strong pursuit of excellence and unrelenting success. We will not forget our country, we will not forget our Constitution, and we will not forget our God. Can’t do that. (Applause.)


Today, I will sign a series of historic executive orders. With these actions, we will begin the complete restoration of America and the revolution of common sense. It’s all about common sense. (Applause.)


First, I will declare a national emergency at our southern border. (Applause.)


All illegal entry will immediately be halted, and we will begin the process of returning millions and millions of criminal aliens back to the places from which they came. We will reinstate my Remain in Mexico policy. (Applause.)


I will end the practice of catch and release. (Applause.)


And I will send troops to the southern border to repel the disastrous invasion of our country. (Applause.)


Under the orders I sign today, we will also be designating the cartels as foreign terrorist organizations. (Applause.)


And by invoking the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, I will direct our government to use the full and immense power of federal and state law enforcement to eliminate the presence of all foreign gangs and criminal networks bringing devastating crime to U.S. soil, including our cities and inner cities. (Applause.)


As commander in chief, I have no higher responsibility than to defend our country from threats and invasions, and that is exactly what I am going to do. We will do it at a level that nobody has ever seen before.


Next, I will direct all members of my cabinet to marshal the vast powers at their disposal to defeat what was record inflation and rapidly bring down costs and prices. (Applause.)


The inflation crisis was caused by massive overspending and escalating energy prices, and that is why today I will also declare a national energy emergency. We will drill, baby, drill. (Applause.)


America will be a manufacturing nation once again, and we have something that no other manufacturing nation will ever have — the largest amount of oil and gas of any country on earth — and we are going to use it. We’ll use it. (Applause.)


We will bring prices down, fill our strategic reserves up again right to the top, and export American energy all over the world. (Applause.)


We will be a rich nation again, and it is that liquid gold under our feet that will help to do it.


With my actions today, we will end the Green New Deal, and we will revoke the electric vehicle mandate, saving our auto industry and keeping my sacred pledge to our great American autoworkers. (Applause.)


In other words, you’ll be able to buy the car of your choice.


We will build automobiles in America again at a rate that nobody could have dreamt possible just a few years ago. And thank you to the autoworkers of our nation for your inspiring vote of confidence. We did tremendously with their vote. (Applause.)


I will immediately begin the overhaul of our trade system to protect American workers and families. Instead of taxing our citizens to enrich other countries, we will tariff and tax foreign countries to enrich our citizens. (Applause.)


For this purpose, we are establishing the External Revenue Service to collect all tariffs, duties, and revenues. It will be massive amounts of money pouring into our Treasury, coming from foreign sources.


The American dream will soon be back and thriving like never before.

To restore competence and effectiveness to our federal government, my administration will establish the brand-new Department of Government Efficiency. (Applause.)


After years and years of illegal and unconstitutional federal efforts to restrict free expression, I also will sign an executive order to immediately stop all government censorship and bring back free speech to America. (Applause.)


Never again will the immense power of the state be weaponized to persecute political opponents — something I know something about. (Laughter.) We will not allow that to happen. It will not happen again.


Under my leadership, we will restore fair, equal, and impartial justice under the constitutional rule of law. (Applause.)


And we are going to bring law and order back to our cities. (Applause.)


This week, I will also end the government policy of trying to socially engineer race and gender into every aspect of public and private life. (Applause.) We will forge a society that is colorblind and merit-based. (Applause.)


As of today, it will henceforth be the official policy of the United States government that there are only two genders: male and female. (Applause.)


This week, I will reinstate any service members who were unjustly expelled from our military for objecting to the COVID vaccine mandate with full back pay. (Applause.)


And I will sign an order to stop our warriors from being subjected to radical political theories and social experiments while on duty. It’s going to end immediately. (Applause.) Our armed forces will be freed to focus on their sole mission: defeating America’s enemies. (Applause.)


Like in 2017, we will again build the strongest military the world has ever seen. We will measure our success not only by the battles we win but also by the wars that we end — and perhaps most importantly, the wars we never get into. (Applause.)


My proudest legacy will be that of a peacemaker and unifier. That’s what I want to be: a peacemaker and a unifier.


I’m pleased to say that as of yesterday, one day before I assumed office, the hostages in the Middle East are coming back home to their families. (Applause.)


Thank you.


America will reclaim its rightful place as the greatest, most powerful, most respected nation on earth, inspiring the awe and admiration of the entire world.


A short time from now, we are going to be changing the name of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America — (applause) — and we will restore the name of a great president, William McKinley, to Mount McKinley, where it should be and where it belongs. (Applause.)


President McKinley made our country very rich through tariffs and through talent — he was a natural businessman — and gave Teddy Roosevelt the money for many of the great things he did, including the Panama Canal, which has foolishly been given to the country of Panama after the United Spates — the United States — I mean, think of this — spent more money than ever spent on a project before and lost 38,000 lives in the building of the Panama Canal.


We have been treated very badly from this foolish gift that should have never been made, and Panama’s promise to us has been broken.


The purpose of our deal and the spirit of our treaty has been totally violated. American ships are being severely overcharged and not treated fairly in any way, shape, or form. And that includes the United States Navy.


And above all, China is operating the Panama Canal. And we didn’t give it to China. We gave it to Panama, and we’re taking it back. (Applause.)


Above all, my message to Americans today is that it is time for us to once again act with courage, vigor, and the vitality of history’s greatest civilization.


So, as we liberate our nation, we will lead it to new heights of victory and success. We will not be deterred. Together, we will end the chronic disease epidemic and keep our children safe, healthy, and disease-free.


The United States will once again consider itself a growing nation — one that increases our wealth, expands our territory, builds our cities, raises our expectations, and carries our flag into new and beautiful horizons.


And we will pursue our manifest destiny into the stars, launching American astronauts to plant the Stars and Stripes on the planet Mars. (Applause.)


Ambition is the lifeblood of a great nation, and, right now, our nation is more ambitious than any other. There’s no nation like our nation.


Americans are explorers, builders, innovators, entrepreneurs, and pioneers. The spirit of the frontier is written into our hearts. The call of the next great adventure resounds from within our souls.


Our American ancestors turned a small group of colonies on the edge of a vast continent into a mighty republic of the most extraordinary citizens on Earth. No one comes close.






restore America promise and we will rebuild the nation that we love — and we love it so much.


We are one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. So, to every parent who dreams for their child and every child who dreams for their future, I am with you, I will fight for you, and I will win for you. We’re going to win like never before. (Applause.)


Thank you. Thank you. (Applause.)

Thank you. Thank you. (Applause.)

In recent years, our nation has suffered greatly. But we are going to bring it back and make it great again, greater than ever before.


We will be a nation like no other, full of compassion, courage, and exceptionalism. Our power will stop all wars and bring a new spirit of unity to a world that has been angry, violent, and totally unpredictable.


America will be respected again and admired again, including by people of religion, faith, and goodwill. We will be prosperous, we will be proud, we will be strong, and we will win like never before.


We will not be conquered, we will not be intimidated, we will not be broken, and we will not fail. From this day on, the United States of America will be a free, sovereign, and independent nation.


We will stand bravely, we will live proudly, we will dream boldly, and nothing will stand in our way because we are Americans. The future is ours, and our golden age has just begun.


Thank you. God bless America. Thank you all. Thank you. (Applause.) Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you. (Applause.)

Thank you. (Applause.)

最重要的是，我今天想要告诉美国人的是：现在是我们再次拿出历史上最伟大文明的勇气、活力和生命力行动起来的时候了。随着我们解放我们的国家，我们将带领她达到新的胜利和成功的高度。我们不会被吓倒。我们将共同结束慢性疾病的流行，让我们的孩子安全、健康、远离疾病。

美国将再次视自己为一个仍在不断壮大中的国家，一个增加我们的财富、扩展我们的领土、建设我们的城市、提升我们的期望、并将我们的旗帜插上崭新而美丽的地平线的国家。我们将追寻我们的天定命运，迈入星辰，将美国宇航员送上火星，并在这颗行星上插上星条旗。

雄心是伟大国家的生命之血，此时此刻，我们的国家比任何其他国家都更具雄心。没有哪个国家像我们的国家。美国人是探险者、建设者、创新者、创业者和开拓者。拓荒精神写入了我们的心灵。下一次伟大冒险的召唤从我们灵魂深处回响。我们的美国先祖将一个位于广袤大陆边缘的一小群殖民地变成了一个由地球上最非凡的公民组成的强大共和国。无人能望其项背。

美国人跋涉数千英里，穿越崎岖的荒野。他们跨越沙漠，攀登高山，勇敢面对无数危险，征服西部荒原，结束奴隶制，从暴政中拯救了数百万人，使数十亿人摆脱贫困，掌握了电力，分裂了原子，将人类送上太空，并将整个人类知识的宇宙浓缩在手掌之间。如果我们齐心协力，没有什么是我们不能完成的，没有什么梦想是我们无法实现的。许多人曾认为我不可能实现如此具有历史意义的政治回归，但正如你们今天所见，我站在这里，美国人民已经发出了声音。

我现在站在这里，就是活生生的证明：永远不要相信有什么事情是不可能完成的。在美国，做成不可能的事情正是我们的强项。

从纽约到洛杉矶，从费城到凤凰城，从芝加哥到迈阿密，从休斯顿到华盛顿特区这里，我们的国家是由一代又一代的爱国者打造和建立的，他们为了我们的权利和自由付出了自己的一切。他们是农民和士兵、牛仔和工厂工人、钢铁工人和煤矿工人、警察和先锋者。他们不断向前推进，奋勇前行，从未让任何障碍击败他们的精神和自豪感。他们共同努力，铺设了铁路，建起了摩天大楼，修建了了不起的公路，赢得了两次世界大战，击败了法西斯主义和共产主义，并战胜了他们面临的每一个挑战。

经历了这些共同的历程后，我们现在站在美国历史上最伟大四年的起点上。在你们的帮助下，我们将恢复美国的应许，重建我们深爱的国家，我们对它是如此的热爱。我们是一个民族，一个家庭，一个在上帝之下的辉煌国家。因此，致每一位为孩子怀抱梦想的父母，以及每一个为未来怀揣梦想的孩子：我与你们同在，我会为你们而战，我将为你们赢得胜利。我们将赢得前所未有的胜利。

谢谢。

近年来，我们的国家经历了巨大的苦难，但我们将让它重新崛起，让它再次伟大，比以往更加伟大。我们将成为一个无与伦比的国家，充满同情、勇气和卓越精神。我们的力量将终结所有战争，把一种新的团结精神带入这个充满愤怒、暴力和完全不可预测的世界。美国将再次受到尊重，再次受到仰慕，包括来自宗教信仰者和善意之人的尊敬。我们将是繁荣的，我们将是自豪的，我们将是强大的，我们将赢得前所未有的胜利。我们不会被征服，我们不会被吓倒，我们不会被击垮，我们不会失败。从今天起，美利坚合众国将是一个自由、主权和独立的国家。我们将勇敢地站立，我们将自豪地生活，我们将大胆地追梦，没有什么能够阻挡我们，因为我们是美国人。未来属于我们，我们的黄金时代刚刚开始。

谢谢，上帝保佑美国。谢谢大家，谢谢！

非常感谢！
